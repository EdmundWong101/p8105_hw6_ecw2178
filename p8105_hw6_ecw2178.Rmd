### Problem 1
```{r}
homicides_raw = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")

homicides = homicides_raw %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>% 
  mutate(resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"),
         victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female"))
```

```{r}
baltimore_homicides = homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_logit = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = baltimore_homicides, family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() 

baltimore_OR = baltimore_logit %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(c(estimate), 
         AdjSE = exp(c(std.error)))) %>% 
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, std.error, AdjSE, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

The adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed is 0.426.

```{r}
city_states = unique(homicides$city_state)

resolved_OR = function(city_state_input){
  city_homicides = homicides %>% 
    filter(city_state == city_state_input)
  
  city_logit = glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = city_homicides, family = binomial()) %>% 
    broom::tidy() 
  
  city_OR = city_logit %>% 
    mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
           AdjSE = exp(std.error)) %>% 
    select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, std.error, AdjSE, p.value) 

  return(tibble(
    Term = city_OR$term,
    Estimate = city_OR$OR,
    CI = city_OR$AdjSE
  ))
}

city_state_OR = 
  tibble(all_cities = city_states) %>% 
  mutate(results = map(all_cities, resolved_OR))

unnest_city_state_OR = 
  city_state_OR %>% 
  unnest(results)

#### Need to create plot and fix CI 
```

### Problem 2

```{r}
data("weather_df")

lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = weather_df) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

boot_sample = function(df) {
  sample_frac(df, replace = TRUE)
}

boot_straps = 
  tibble(strap_number = 1:5000) |> 
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(df = weather_df))
  )

boot_straps
```

### Problem 3

```{r}
birthweight_raw = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv")
str(birthweight_raw)
```

```{r}

```
